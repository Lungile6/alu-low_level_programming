## Project Title: C Programming Basics

### Description
This project includes a series of C programs that demonstrate fundamental programming concepts, including the use of the preprocessor, compiler, and basic I/O operations.

### Files Overview

1. **`0-preprocessor.c`**
   - Demonstrates the use of the C preprocessor. It showcases how to include libraries and basic output.

2. **`1-compiler.c`**
   - Illustrates the compilation process of C code. It emphasizes the importance of compiling code before execution.

3. **`2-assembler.c`**
   - Provides an example of the assembly stage in C programming, explaining the transformation of code into machine language.

4. **`3-name.c`**
   - Focuses on naming conventions in C programs and how to properly set up a basic program structure.

5. **`4-puts.c`**
   - Uses the `puts` function to print a string, highlighting simple string output in C.

6. **`5-printf.c`**
   - Demonstrates formatted output using the `printf` function, showing how to include grammar and punctuation in output.

7. **`6-size.c`**
   - Explains the `sizeof` operator by printing the sizes of various data types, providing insight into memory allocation in C.

### Compilation
To compile any of the programs, use the following command:
```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 filename.c
```

### Execution
Run the compiled program with:
```bash
./a.out
```

### Requirements
- A C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)
- Basic understanding of C programming concepts
