# Nested While Loops in C

## Overview
This repository contains examples and explanations of nested while loops in C programming. It focuses on understanding how to use functions effectively, along with the importance of function prototypes and header files.

## Learning to Program in C (Part 06)
In Part 06 of our programming series, we explore the use of functions in C, specifically focusing on nested while loops. This segment stops at 14:00.

## What is the Purpose of a Function Prototype?
A function prototype is a declaration of a function that tells the compiler about the function's name, return type, and parameters. It allows:
- **Type Checking**: Ensures that the function is called with the correct number and types of arguments.
- **Separation of Declaration and Definition**: You can define functions after they are called in the code.
- **Improved Code Organization**: Keeps function declarations in a central location, making the code easier to read.

### Example of a Function Prototype
```c
int add(int a, int b); // Prototype
C - Header Files
Header files in C are used to declare functions, structures, and macros that can be shared across multiple source files. They usually have a .h extension.

Key Points about Header Files
Reusability: Allows code to be reused in different programs.
Organization: Helps keep related declarations together.
Standard Libraries: Many standard libraries are included via header files (e.g., #include <stdio.h>).
Example of a Header File
c

Copy
// my_functions.h
#ifndef MY_FUNCTIONS_H
#define MY_FUNCTIONS_H

int add(int a, int b);
void print_message(void);

#endif // MY_FUNCTIONS_H
Conclusion
Understanding nested while loops, function prototypes, and header files is essential for effective programming in C. This knowledge will help you write more organized and maintainable code.
